# My Emacs Configuration

This is my personal Emacs configuration. I’m beginning to discover
Emacs from scratch, so I’m expecting this configuration to evolve over
the coming months and years.

The custom configuration part is defined in [config.org](config.org),
which contains source snippets with the Emacs Lisp code that performs
the configuration.
